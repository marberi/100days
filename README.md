# 100days
100 days of AI/ML. The requirement of the challenge is to study or apply AI/ML
each day for 100 days. The first 100 days started from January 4th and
successfully ended 27th of April
([log](https://github.com/marberi/100days/blob/master/first100.md)). After a
break, the next 100 day challenge started on May 2nd.

# Day 101 [2019-05-02]
Today I was preparing for a talk on deep learning on Fridays, using at least 10
hours today. This is mostly about making slides and reading up on all kind of
background material. While it is an internal seminar, it is always good to be
prepared. You also learn a lot yourself. The biggest surprise was learning
about [Habana Labs](https://habana.ai/), which is a startup semiconductor
company. They claim having a interence processor handling 15000 img/sec,
compared to 2657/sec on a Resnet50 architecture. Also, by accident I found
[Katakoda](https://www.katacoda.com/), which seems useful.

# Day 102 [2019-05-03]
At least by now I have a complete set of slides. Basically took the full day.
This talk covers history, trends in artificial intelligence (AI), hardware,
software/Infrastructure, details on neural networks, astronomy applications,
outlook and conclusions. It covers a serious amount of material, so I could
even have spent more time on reading background material.

# Day 103 [2019-05-04]
Gave the talk today. It was well received. This night I was looking into how
to predict the corresponding errors to a prediction. Many of the papers was
extremely old, like from 20 years ago. It was not clear if these would be a
good fit for our problem. In the end I found that searching for "neural network
prediction interval" gave lots of better hits.
