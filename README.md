# 100days
100 days of AI/ML. Study or apply AI/ML for at least 1 hour each of the next
100 days, starting at January 19. 

# Day 1 [2019-01-19]

Started the course on computational linear algebra
[https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/]. I finished part zero and
got halfways into the first.

# Day 2 [2019-01-20]
Finished week 1 of the course. While most was known, they had a nice example
on calculalation stability. Also an interesting example from a linked Halid
talk on how to speedup a naive convolution in C++ with a factor of 11x. It
got me thinking on my own code.
