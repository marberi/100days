successfully ended 27th of April
([log](https://github.com/marberi/100days/blob/master/first100.md)). After a
break, the next 100 day challenge started on May 2nd.

# Day 101 [2019-05-02]
Today I was preparing for a talk on deep learning on Fridays, using at least 10
hours today. This is mostly about making slides and reading up on all kind of
background material. While it is an internal seminar, it is always good to be
prepared. You also learn a lot yourself. The biggest surprise was learning
about [Habana Labs](https://habana.ai/), which is a startup semiconductor
company. They claim having a interence processor handling 15000 img/sec,
compared to 2657/sec on a Resnet50 architecture. Also, by accident I found
[Katakoda](https://www.katacoda.com/), which seems useful.
